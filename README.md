# Bus Ticket Management System

## Program Description

This Bus Ticket Management system is a command-line Python application designed to simulate a real-world bus ticket booking experience. It allows users to:

- **Create and manage user accounts** with secure login and signup workflows, including OTP verification for added security.  
- **Search for buses** by either bus number or destination to quickly find available routes.  
- **Book tickets** by specifying passenger details and ensuring seat availability before confirming bookings.  
- **Cancel tickets** to free up seats, with immediate updates to the bus seat inventory.  

The program maintains data about buses, users, and tickets using Python dictionaries and lists, focusing on clear structure and easy expandability. It’s an excellent project for beginners to understand fundamental programming concepts like control flow, data handling, and user interaction.

## Contributions

- **My Contribution:**  
  I designed and developed a Python-based Bus Ticket Management system from scratch. This project includes core functionalities such as user authentication (login and signup with OTP verification), searching buses by number or destination, booking tickets with seat availability checks, and ticket cancellation with real-time seat updates. I structured the program to be modular and easy to extend as I continue learning and improving my coding skills.

- **ChatGPT’s Contribution:**  
  I leveraged OpenAI’s ChatGPT to review and refine my code, troubleshoot bugs, and improve overall structure and logic flow. ChatGPT helped me implement best practices, suggested minor improvements, and guided me through Git version control commands and repository setup, accelerating my learning journey.
By this project i get to learn lot of things in logic implementation, looping and fucntions implementations, usage of the modules and modular programming way.
